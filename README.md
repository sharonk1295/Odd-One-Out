# Odd-One-Out
SEIR-Nova Unit 1 Project - Odd One Out Trivia Game

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to build my project. 
Odd One Out is a trivia game that was mainly built with modals. I mainly had trouble with maintaining DRY code and working with repsonsive web design.

To play the game, first click on the "Let's Go!" button and read the welcoming/instructions page. Then, choose a category to play a round of the game! After winning/losing, the user can play again from the beginning and try a different category.
